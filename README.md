# brain-trainer

Ok. So I've been trying to start planning for a really really long time, but I just can't. I mean, every time I write down a plan I either: try to follow it for one day but fail and give up or don't even try at all. So tomorrow (May 11) I just finally wanna sit down and try to start planning. I'm gonna start it with my brain-trainer project. I'm gonna wake up, get a breakfast and do other routine, and then just sit down and see what I can do in 1 hour. Then do it. Then come back home and try again. And so on. And then try it with other activities (after project is done). Until I finally master the skill of planning.

Plan (2 weeks left):
May 11: Arithmetic chains exercise full.
May 12-14: 2 more exercises + stick everything together.
May 15: Rating system and get ready for stat collection.
May 16-17: Introduce stats: table + graph.
... work harder

Todo:
* Leave exercise properly
* Nav pane fade in / out animation
* Shape fusion exercise CORRECT / WRONG status bar position should depend on the number of terms (and should be constrained between the top bar and the top card)
* Progress tab on exercise completed
* FOLLOW YOUR PLAN IN THE PRESENTATION!
* Exercise start window
* Exercise list sections
* Do todos (maybe? make a custom layout manager for RecyclerView for exercise list)
* Come up with name
