# Todo name (NeuroNation form fever)

Type: memory & attention

You have some boxes. Each box has a description which you need to memorize (it later disappears). Items start appearing inside these boxes, and you
need to tell whether a certain item matches the description of the box it appears in (you have limited time). More boxes can appear as you're playing.
