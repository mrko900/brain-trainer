# Remember numbers

Type: memory

Remember a given number. Some exciting stuff may be added just for fun (the way the number is shown, the way the digits disappear).
<p>To make it even more exciting, a version of this exercise might require you to remember multiple numbers at the same time. E.g. you are shown one number, then the other, then you need to input both.
